# ThreadingUsingOmp_Amp
Number of projects using omp and amp C++ 11 threading.</br>
</br>
Projects include: </br>
1- LCS using threads. </br>
2- kMeans algorithm (just 1-D) using threads.</br>
3- Text search using threads.</br>
4- Mandelbrot Fractals (smiple version) using threads and AMP.</br>
</br>
<strong>ALL algorithms are implemented with serial soluations first to be able to compare them.</strong>  </br>
